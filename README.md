# Capri powered by TinaCMS ðŸ¦™

This [Capri](https://capri.build) demo is powered by [TinaCMS](https://app.tina.io).

It is a port of the [Tina Cloud Starter](https://github.com/tinacms/tina-cloud-starter) template
to show how Capri can be used instead of Next.js.

As a result, you get a completely static site that does not need a Node server and can be deployed
to any static hosting service, including S3, GitHub Pages, surge or Firebase Hosting.

The cool thing is that the resulting website will ship **zero KB of JavaScript** to the browser.
Still, under `/admin` you get the full Tina editing experience as single page app!

The easiest way to get started is to use this 1-click starter button:
